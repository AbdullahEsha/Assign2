  <h2> What is an MP3?</h2>
  <P>An mp3 file is an audio file type created using compression technology to reduce file size. It is called a
    "lossy" format because the compression process is irreversible. An average compressed mp3 file is about 3 MB.
  </p>
  <h2> What is the File MP3 used For </h2>
  <p> The MP3 file format is used to store digital audio data. </p>
  <h2> The History Of MP3 </h2>
  <dl>
    <dt> <strong> Who invented and developed MP3 ? </strong> </dt>
    <dd> MP3 was invented and developed by the German Company â€œFraunhofer-Gesellshaft and has licensed patents to the
      compression technology until its recent demise. The inventors listed on the patent here were Karlheinz
      Brandenburg (also known as the "father of the MP3), Ernst Eberlein, Bernhard Grill, Thomas Sporer and Bernd
      Kurten. </dd>
    <dt> <strong>initial release </strong> </dt>
    <dd> 6 December 1991 </dd>
    <dt> <strong> Why did they create it? </strong> </dt>
    <dd> to provide a high-quality, low-bitrate copy of a sound file </dd>
    <h2> What are the advantages and disadvantages of the MP3 </h2>
    <section>
      <h3> Advantages </h3>
      <ol>
        <li> Without patents: The cost of distributing music via streaming is low, allowing new artists to distribute
          their compositions because they don't have to pay for a medium like a CD to access their music. This is also
          enabled for streaming audio books, podcasts and sound effects </li>
        <li> Cost: The MP3 format is currently a free format, it does not require paying licenses or royalties for
          patents </li>
        <li> Practicality: MP3 is an audio format that can be easily transmitted over the network </li>
      </ol>
      <h3> Disadvantages </h3>
      <ol>
        <li> Loss of Sound Quality: MP3 files are considered a "lossy" digital audio format type for a reason when MP3
          files are compressed, the original recording quality is sacrificed to make the file size smaller.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>
    <h2> What is the current and future state of MP3 </h2>
    <p> The mp3 format is over 30 years old, so the age of MP3 is officially over, which means that newly released
      devices will stop supporting the mp3 file.</p>

    <h3> What is an MP4? </h3>
    <p> MPEG-4 Part 14 (MP4) is a multimedia container format that can store video, audio, subtitles, and other media
      files.</p>
