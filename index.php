			<h2> MP3 </h2>
			<p1>
				<li> MP3 is a standard technology and compressed audio file format stands for "MPEG Audio Layer-3,
					" which is developed by MPEG (Moving Picture Experts Group).
					A file extension and compression method for compressing a sound sequence into a very small file
					while
					still retaining audio quality as comparad to a CD.
					Commonly, MP3 files need less disk space and are used to hold a song or the whole CD data.</li><br>

				<li> A computer can save many numbers of songs, even several hundred or thousands, as MP3 files require
					very
					small storage space.
					There is a number of websites that allow users to download MP3 files, which are identified with the
					file
					name suffix of " mp3 ".</li>

				<li> In 1894, with the help of a tone of lower frequency, another tone could be rendered inaudible that
					was
					reported by the American physicist Alfred M. Mayer. Regarding this phenomenon, a complete set of
					auditory curves was described by Richard Ehmer in 1959.

					The German company Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft developed the MP3 and held the patent for MP3 technology
					too.
				</li><br><br>

				<li> In 1987, research on high quality, low bit rate audio encoding was started by the Fraunhofer
					Institute
					Integrierte Schaltungen that was a research center and a part of Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft and gave
					this
					project name EUREKA EU147. At the University of Erlangen, Dieter Seitzer, when he was working on
					transferring audio file information over a standard telephone line, helped with the coding.
					Karlheinz
					Brandenburg, originally known as the father of MP3 because his brain was the man behind the
					development
					of the MP3.</li><br><br>

				<li> In 1972, a type of transform coding, the discrete cosine transformed (DCT), was proposed by Nasir
					Ahmed
					for lossy compression, and in 1973, Ahmed with T. Natarajan and K. R. Rao developed it. Also, its
					result
					was out by them in 1974.

					Since 1977, he had been researching compression methods as he was an electronics specialist and
					mathematics. An adaptive predictive coding, LPC speech codec was proposed by Manfred R. Schroeder
					and
					Bishnu S. Atal at Bell Labs in 1978, in which, to exploiting the masking properties of the human
					ear,
					using the psychoacoustic coding algorithm. Later in 1979, a paper was reported for further
					optimization
					by Atal and Schroeder. </li> <br><br>

				<li> After this, in 1987, J. P. Princen, A. W. Johnson, and A. B. Bradley, by following the earlier In
					April
					1989, a patent to the technology was granted to Fraunhofer. Almost, the MP3 file format did not
					exist,
					according to Brandenburg. The encoding did not want to work in 1991 during the modification test.
					But
					they identified and solved the compiler error; till then, the first version of the MP3 codec was not
					submitted. In 1999, to distribute their music as MP3s online, the first record label was the record
					label Sub-Pop, which was one small relatively unknown fact in this year.</li><br><br>
